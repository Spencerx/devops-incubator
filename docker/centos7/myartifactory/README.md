# Artifactory on CentOS 6

This image contains Artifactory running on CentOS 6 base image 

## Start Container 

### Attached to console (but no tty so cannot be stopped by Control-C)
    docker run -p 12365:12365 hgomez/di-centos6-myartifactory

### Detached
    docker run -d -p 12365:12365 hgomez/di-centos6-myartifactory

### Interactive mode
    docker run -t -i -p 12365:12365 hgomez/di-centos6-myartifactory

## Externalize Artifactory Home

Create local directory and ensure it's available to all
myartifactory will use user myarti (uid 1239) and need access to this repo

    mkdir -p /home/henri/artifactory-data
    chmod 777 /home/henri/artifactory-data

Mount the local directory, /home/henri/artifactory-data, into the container as the /var/lib/myartifactory directory

    docker run -v /home/henri/artifactory-data:/var/lib/myartifactory -p 12365:12365 hgomez/di-centos6-myartifactory
